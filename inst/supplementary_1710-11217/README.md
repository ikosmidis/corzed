====

This directory contains code and reports distributed as part of the supplementary material of

Di Caterina, C and Kosmidis, I (2019). Location-Adjusted Wald Statistics for Scalar Parameters. ArXiv E-Prints. [arXiv:1710.11217](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11217)

### `code/` (directory):
The directory provides scripts with helper functions and simulation studies to reproduce the results in Di Caterina and Kosmidis (2019).

### `lesion data/` (directory):
The example data that were distributed as an illustration of the methodology in

Tian Ge, Nicole Muller-Lenke, Kerstin Bendfeldt, Thomas E. Nichols, & Timothy D. Johnson (2014). "Analysis Of Multiple Sclerosis Lesions Via Spatially Varying Coefficients". Ann. Appl. Stat. 8 (2): 1095-â€“1118.

The lesion data directory is a copy of the files in the archive [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/software/bsglmm/manual/data_demo.dat.tar.gz)
provided in the [user guide](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/software/bsglmm) of the software that implements the methods in the aforementioned paper.

### `results/` (directory):
This directory holds the R image files from the simulation and case study scripts in `code/` (`babies_simulation.R`, `babies_times.R`, `brains_case_study.R`, `clotting_simulation.R`, `dyslexia_simulation.R`, `meta_analysis_simulation.R`)

### `corzed_supplementary_code.Rmd`
An R markdown file that fully reproduces the numerical results and outputs in [arXiv:1710.11217](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11217) and includes supplementary and enriched outputs from the numerical computations and simulation experiments therein.

The corresponding output is in `corzed_supplementary_code.pdf` and `corzed_supplementary_code.html`
